Angular chat app by using MEAN and socket.io.

it's simple to use our chat app but before showing you how to use it,  I would like to tell you how socket works, socket enables bi-directional communication, bi-directional means 2-way communication  <br> 

In simple words, If I say Hii to you, you will say hello to me similarly, you can think of the socket bi-directional communication <br> 

If a client sends a message to the server and the server quickly sends a message back to the client in a few seconds.

Let's directly jump and see how messages quickly send to the server and client. 

You don't need to do much work to make this project run instead you just need to do some basic things,  dont worry, follow the step one by one.

## Step 1 - Clone the project 
``` Open the visual studio code, type git clone https://github.com/Avishkar-IT-Services/Angular-SocketIO-Chat.git ```

After hitting enter, now you can see 2 folders <br>
1. Client <br>
2. Server <br>

### Configure server 
Open  the `.env` file and change the database url as per your database config, mostly base url is same but the database name is different

If you want to run the server in a different port, then you can change the port in the `server.js` file  and also you need to change url in client also

## Run the project 

### Server <br>
Open the client side terminal and type ``` npm run start ```, in order to start the server

### MongoDB <br>
Open the MonogoDB compass and click on connect button

### Client <br>
Open the client side terminal and type ``` ng serve -o```, it will automatically open the app in the browser.
