Angular chat app by using MEAN and socket.io.

it's simple to use our chat app but before showing you how to use it,  I would like to tell you how socket works, socket enables bi-directional communication, bi-directional means 2-way communication - <br> 

In simple words, If I say Hii to you, you will say hello to me similarly, you can think of the socket bi-directional communication <br> 

If a client sends some message to the server and server immediately back to the client in a few seconds.

Let's directly jump on how to use this project.

You don't need to do much work to make this run instead you just need to do some basic things,  dont worry, follow the step one by one.

## Step 1 - Clone the project 
``` Open the visual studio code, type git clone https://github.com/Avishkar-IT-Services/Angular-SocketIO-Chat.git ```

1. Client <br>
2. Server <br>
