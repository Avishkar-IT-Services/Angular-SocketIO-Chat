Angular chat app by using MEAN and socket.io.

it's simple to use our chat app but before showing you how to use it,  I would like to tell you how socket works, socket enables bi-directional communication, bi-directional means 2-way communication - <br> 

In simple words, If I say Hii to you, you will say hello to me similarly, you can think of the socket bi-directional communication <br> 

If a client sends some message to the server and server immediately back to the client in a few seconds.
